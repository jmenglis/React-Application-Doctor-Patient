# Tempus Coding Challenge

## Summary

This application was created as part of the Tempus coding challenge.  The requirements for this application were:
-Design an appealing web application
-Create a single login page for Doctors and Patients
-Doctors will login and the system will show details of a patient.
-Patients will login and the system will allow them to upload files or multiple files.

## Technologies Used
-HTML5
-CSS
-SASS
-Node
-ReactJS
-MongoDB
-Webpack
-Javascript(ES6)

## Known Changes
-I initially used the file system to store the data but I decided that I can better secure the data by converting it to a blob(base64) and storing in the database assigned to particular user.  This can cause bloated size in the database but the plan would be to store these files on another server.

## Incomplete Items
-More time could have been spent on improving the user experience.
-Refactor the code and combine some of the ReactJS components.
